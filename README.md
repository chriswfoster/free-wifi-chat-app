<h2>
I plan on hosting this chat app on a raspberry pi. It's a very simple, and plain chat app. It will require more up to date browsers, but most cellular devices should be able to view this properly. 
</h2>
<p>
  The main goal- is to broadcast wifi from one of my devices (instead of listening to for access points, I'll broadcast my own). When people connect, all port 80, 8080, and 443 traffic will be redirected to this chat app hosted on the Pi. This should come in handy at social events or maybe even public transportation where people may not want to talk.
  </p>

Some back ground info on the app. When you hit the website, node will hand out a build folder, a front end react app will load, you'll be given a random user name at login (as seen in screenshots below), and immediately you can begin typing. I may add more functionality later, but I'd really just like to test this in a few public places to see how this goes.
